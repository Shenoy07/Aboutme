          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p> I am a software engineer currently working a full-time job that was getting too monotonous and was nowhere near to
               web development so, I decided to work on some projects of my own. I was always interested in 
              web development in college but couldn't work on it as I  always had some misconceptions.</p>

          <h1>What do I do?</h1>
      </section>
      <section class="questions-section">
          <p>
            I learn about web technologies and make projects based on my learnings. 
            Till now I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some medium-level React.js. 
            I document all my projects on my blog 
            <a href="https://shenoywrites.hashnode.dev/">https://shenoywrites.hashnode.dev/</a>  
          </p>
          <h1>Why the blog?</h1>
          <p>The main purpose of the blog is to help beginners in web development to follow
            a specific path and give them verified resources for learning technologies.
            It will help them avoid unnecessary deviation from what they should be learning. 
        </p>
        <h1>My Aim?</h1>
        <p>
            I have just started 2 months ago and I have reached till here which I think is very impressive given 
            that I have a 9 hr full-time job. I am looking for some companies to hire me as a web developer 
            (So If you are interested to hire a dedicated engineer for your project/company, 
            feel free to reach out to me anytime). 
        </p>
        <h1>Why should you contact me?</h1>
        <p>
            Feel free to contact me any time if you want to appreciate,
             give some constructive criticism or want to collaborate with me for your projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, if you wish to talk about anything related to time management, I will be up for it. Maybe I am not qualified for it,
            but I can surely share my experience from the past few months with you, which I think will help you.
